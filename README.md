TCS, MRF, RELIANCE
First of all, I wanted to analyze Indian companies, so obviously I thought of picking wellknown blue chip companies. Reliance Industries is the biggest company in India, followed by TCS owned by the TATA group. And for(Madras Rubber Factory) MRF I found it interesting since it has the highest Share Price in India.

First I plotted the 50 and 100-day moving averages to get a smooth Idea of the company's stock price along with the Volume. All of them show a rising moving average which in turn indicates that the security is in an uptrend. Reliance shows a sideways market till 2017 which happened because of an interanl split in the company followed by an upward trend breakout.

Then comes the time plot. which is just a line plot with the time series data on the y-axis and the time index on the x-axis. the daily returns are closer to zero and what I understood is that MRF daily log returns are less volatile than the others. Also, unusually large daily movements are shown most around 2020 which I hope is during the first lockdown due to covid.

Finally, Histogram and smoothed density plots. All histograms have a bell shape like the normal distribution and are almost centered around zero. The histogram for the MRF returns is slightly skewed right due to more large positive returns than negative returns whereas the histograms for the other both are almost symmetric.
